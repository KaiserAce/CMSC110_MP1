      <p>The family of UPB Cats welcomed Gwen, a white and orange tabby PusPin to the campus last December, 2023.</br></br>A familiar face, Gwen had originally resided at the Baguio Convention Center and greeted UPB students whenever they would visit the FamilyMart convenience store beside the Convention Center.</br></br> 
        According to volunteers from the Cats of UPB community, university personnel had attempted to find a private foster family for Gwen as Gwen had a tendency to antagonize the original resident cats of the campus.</br></br>
        Gwen now roams around the campus and prefers to sleep inside the lobby of the Alumni Building, found between the Institute of Management Plaza and the College of Social Sciences Courtyard.</br></br>

      <p>Over two dozen reports of cat-related injuries were filed by students at the University of the Philippines Baguio Health Service Office (UPB-HSO) over the month of September.</br></br>
        According to the HSO, the reported injuries by the students, who mostly comprised of freshmen and sophomores, were commonly cat scratches and cat bites, with instances of sprained ankles.</br></br>
        “These incidents could be avoided if students abstained from petting the cats around the campus,” said the HSO.</br></br>
        People inside the campus are discouraged from touching  cats inside the UPB campus because some of the resident felines are not as friendly to human hands.</br></br>
        Feeding the cats outside of their official routine meal windows is also strongly discouraged, as this could disrupt the scheduled conditioning of the cats.</br></br>
        Campus staff feed the UPB cats twice daily at exactly 10:00 in the morning and 5:00 in the afternoon.</br></br>

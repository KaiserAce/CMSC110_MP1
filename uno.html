      <p>The Cats of UPB community publicly announced last October 23rd the passing of Uno, the senior white and grey tabby Puspin cat who lived in the College of Arts and Communication.</br></br>
        Uno was reported missing by several concerned students during the second week of October and eventually found, having peacefully passed, by sir Ricky de Lima within the vicinity of the college.</br></br>
        According to de Lima, Uno fell ill and succumbed to infection despite treatment.</br></br>
        Uno is the second cat the UP Baguio cat lover community has had to bid farewell to after the recent passing of the calico Mumshie several months prior to Unoâ€™s departure.

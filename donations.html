      <p>A bundle of cat collars, cat food, cat litter, and cat medicine were sent to University of the Philippines Baguio by Pilly's Pet Supplies last April 23rd, 2024.</br></br>
      Volunteers from the Cats of UPB community equipped the campus cats with the newly donated collars, distinguishing the resident felines of the university from stray cats who enter the vicinity of UP Baguio occasionally.</br></br> 
      “Let us actively protect our furry companions and constantly shower them with the love, care, respect, and kindness that they deserve,” said the Cats of UPB in a Facebook post in celebration of April being Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Month. </br></br>

      <p>Last September 16th, the Cats of UPB volunteer community facilitated a schoolwide vaccination program.</br></br>
        The vaccination drive focues on updating the anti-rabies medications of the resident cats inside the University of the Philippines Baguio campus.</br></br>
        Among the heads of the vaccination drive were Sir Ricky De Lima, a security personnel from the university and Dr. Ana Herrera, a resident veterinarian of Diskubre Pet Shop.</br></br>
        “We are now vaccinated! Thank you so much,” said the Cats of UPB community page in a Facebook post.</br></br>
        According to VCA Animal Hospitals, it is recommended for adult cats to be vaccinated against common cat diseases, such as Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and Feline panleukopenia (FPV).</br></br>
        While these diseases significantly shorten the lifespan of cats, untrained bystanders are discouraged from attempting medication, as certain chemicals which are safe for humans—for instance, paracetamol, are lethal to felines.</br></br>
